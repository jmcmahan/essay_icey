In this game, you play as Chuck, a worker at the Essay Icey
(which is a misspelling now set in stone, argh! - should be "Icy") company. Your
goal is to accomplish the tasks given to you by your boss, John, until he
has nothing left to give you. This is accomplished by picking up items
around the building and asking your coworkers for hints. Move with the 
directional pad and talk to people or pick up items with the A button.
